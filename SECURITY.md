# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently all containers are supported, since they all share the common base, differing in buildroot versions 
and how far along the pre-build, though this may be subject to change in the future. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vulnerability is related to a components of the containers (ubuntu, buildroot, etc), report it to the developer of that component, 
not here. 

If the vulnerability is already patched upstream and simply needs to be integrated into this project, create a new issue in the Issue Tracker. 
If the vulnerability is in the actual implementation, or you have concerns about publically disclosing the issue in the Issue Tracker, contact me
at 9311953+Marsfan@users.noreply.github.com, and I will respond as quickly as possible.
